# Hypothesis-Testing

Using the European Soccer Dataset from Kaggle, a few questions were statistically analyzed, namely - Does the traditional belief in the existence of an underlying advantage for European soccer teams playing at home have statistical significance? What formation has a better overall rate of victory, the 4–4–2 or the 4–3–3? 

## Dataset and Methodology
The data is sourced from an SQL database. The null and alternative hypotheses were stated first. Then, the necessary data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering, and data organization were performed. The effect size (quantifying the difference between two groups) was then calculated to help determine the appropriate sample size. The powers of each hypothesis varied, but an alpha of 0.05 was maintained throughout each test. This alpha, or the significance level (α), is the probability of making the wrong decision when the null hypothesis is true. It was desired to keep this consistent while performing various t-tests and the p-values generated from them.
